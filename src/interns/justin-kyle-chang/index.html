        Hello! My name is <b>Justin Kyle Chang</b>. I am a 2nd-year student at UCLA (from the Bay Area) pursuing a 
        B.E. degree in Computer Science and aspiring to be a software engineer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus and interest lie in web development, particularly in front-end design (HTML5, CSS3, JS/JSX); however, 
        I am open to exploring all fields of Computer Science! My desire for becoming a software engineer roots from 
        my passion to problem solve, create, and provide. I enjoy developing applications that not only benefit me but 
        also the people around me. Being able to see my days, months, or even years of hard work in a culminating 
        product gives me such a satisfying euphoria and sense of accomplishment. I love the feeling of spending hours 
        and hours solving a problem and finally pushing through and finding the solution. 
        These moments are what pushes me to become a software engineer.
      </p> 
      <p className="about-main-paragraph">
        In the Lob internship, I am hoping to achieve three main things: create new social bonds, build/contribute to an 
        application, and learn how it's like to code in the industry. After reviewing the Lob Internship Job Description, 
        I am very excited to work on topics regarding web applications! I am hoping to further develop both my client and 
        server-side knowledge over this summer. I am very excited about this opportunity and hope that I can be your guy's 
        2021 summer intern! Thanks for your time!
